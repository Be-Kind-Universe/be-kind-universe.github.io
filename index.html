    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> &bull; </strong
      ><strong>IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Our servers are located in _______________.If you are accessing our
      Platforms from outside the United States, please be aware that your
      information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our
      facilities and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal
      information (see &ldquo;WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH
      ANYONE?&rdquo; above), in and other countries.Your personal data may be
      transferred to and stored by persons outside the United States, and in
      particular may be transferred to and stored by affiliates or service
      providers of The Be Kind Universe outside the United States. Where
      personal data is transferred outside the United States, we will ensure
      that the transfer is subject to appropriate safeguards or is otherwise
      permitted under applicable law. For example, in the context of personal
      data transferred outside the United States, the country to which the
      personal data is transferred may be a European Economic Area member, a
      country approved by the European Commission or the recipient may have
      agreed to model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission
      that oblige them to protect the personal data. You can obtain more details
      of the protection given to your personal data when it is transferred
      outside the United States or the European Economic Area, including a copy
      of any standard data protection clauses entered into with recipients of
      your personal data, by contacting us using the details set out below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> &bull; </strong
      ><strong>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
      for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention
      period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements).
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
      information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
      this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
      been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
      information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> &bull; </strong
      ><strong>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
      measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
      process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
      storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
      promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
      third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
      collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do

        &bull; DO YOU HAVE A SEPARATE POLICY FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF
        13?</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules
      (collectively, "<strong>COPPA</strong>") require us to inform parents and
      legal guardians (as used in this policy, "<strong>parents</strong>") about
      our practices for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information
      from children under the age of 13 ("<strong>children</strong>"). It also
      requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child's parent for certain
      collection, use, and disclosure of the child's personal information.
    </p>
    <p>This section notifies parents of:</p>
    <p>The types of information we may collect from children.</p>
    <p>How we use the information we collect.</p>
    <p>Our practices for disclosing that information.</p>
    <p>
      Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents' consent when we collect
      personal information from children, including how a parent may revoke
      consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      All operators that collect or maintain information from children through
      the Platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section 1 only applies to children under the age of 13 and
      supplements the other provisions of this privacy policy. This section does
      not apply to teens and adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will obtain parental consent before asking for personal information on
      our Platforms directed to children under the age of 13, unless the request
      for information falls within an exception that would be permitted under
      COPPA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terms that are defined in the other sections of this privacy policy have
      the same meanings as used in this section.
    </p>
    <p>Information We Collect from Children</p>
    <p>
      Children will not be able to access our Platforms and its content without
      signing up as a registered user. All content and features are available
      only to registered users. To register for an account, a user will need to
      register with a valid email address.In addition, we use certain
      technologies, such as cookies, to automatically collect information from
      our users (including children) when they visit or use our Platforms. We do
      not make personal information collected from children publicly available,
      nor do we enable children to do so on our Platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably
      necessary for the child to participate in an activity, and we do not
      condition his or her participation on the disclosure of more personal
      information than is reasonably necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Information We Collect Directly</p>
    <p>We collect the following information directly:</p>
    <p>
      &bull;Persistent Identifiers.&nbsp;When users interact with&nbsp;our
      Platforms, certain information may automatically be collected, both to
      make our Platforms more interesting and useful to children and for various
      purposes related to our business. This includes information regarding the
      frequency with which the child visits or engages with parts of our
      Platforms. This information is collected using technologies such as
      cookies, flash cookies, web beacons, and other unique identifiers. This
      information will be collected solely by us. This data is principally used
      for internal purposes only, in order to:&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Provide children with access to features and activities on our
      Platforms.
    </p>
    <p>&bull;Customize content and improve our Platforms.</p>
    <p>
      &bull;Conduct research and analysis to address the performance of our
      Platforms.
    </p>
    <p>&bull;Generate anonymous reporting for use by us.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      &bull;Email. In connection with certain activities or services, we may
      collect a child's online contact information, such as an email address, in
      order to communicate with the child more than once. In such instances, we
      will retain the child's online contact information to honor the request
      and for no other purpose such as marketing. One example would be a
      newsletter that provides occasional updates about our Platforms. Whenever
      we collect a child's online contact information&nbsp;for ongoing
      communications, we will simultaneously require a parent email address in
      order to notify the parent about the collection and use of the child's
      information, as well as to provide the parent an opportunity to prevent
      further contact with the child.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Push Notifications. Push notifications are notifications on mobile
      and other devices that are typically associated with downloaded
      applications, and which can communicate to the device holder even when the
      application is not in use. We will require a child to provide a parent
      email address before the child can receive push notifications from our
      child-directed applications that collect a device identifier. We will then
      provide the parent with notice of our contact with the child and will
      provide the parent with the opportunity to prevent further notifications.
      Finally, we will not associate the device identifier with other personal
      information without contacting the parent to get consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &bull;Transactional Information. Transactional information directly when
      users request information, make purchases, returns, requests, or exchanges
      for products or services. This includes, but is not limited to, postal
      addresses, telephone numbers, and payment details.
    </p>
    <p>
      [We may enable registered users to communicate with others on or through
      our Platforms through chat, email, and posting to public areas of the
      Platforms ("<strong>Social Features</strong>"). The nature of these
      features allows children to disclose personal information about
      themselves. We do not monitor or review this content before it is posted,
      and we do not control the actions of third parties with whom your child
      shares his or her information. We encourage parents to educate their
      children about safe internet use and to monitor their children's use of
      social features.]
    </p>
    <p>
      We may request additional information from your child, but this
      information is optional. We specify whether information is required or
      optional when we request it.
    </p>
    <p>Automatic Information Collection and Tracking</p>

      including children, when they access and navigate through our

      these technologies may include:

      Information that identifies the usage, technical, device data and device
      type accessing our Platforms, either directly or through third-party

      other non-personal information we collect to improve our Platforms and to
      deliver a better and more personalized experience by enabling us to:

      the content according to individual interests.

    <p>
      We use geolocation information we collect to enhance user experiences and
      improve safety and efficiency on our Platforms.
    </p>
    <p>Our Practices for Disclosing Children's Information</p>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer children's personal information
      other than as described in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and
      information that does not identify any individual or device. In addition,
      we may disclose children's personal information:
    </p>
    <p>
      To third parties we use to support the internal operations of our
      Platforms and who are bound by contractual or other obligations to use the
      information only for such purpose and to keep the information
      confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply
      with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or
      regulatory request.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the
      rights, property, or safety of us, our customers or others, including to:
    </p>
    <p>protect the safety of a child;</p>
    <p>protect the safety and security of the Platform; or</p>
    <p>enable us to take precautions against liability.</p>
    <p>
      To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public
      safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring,
      reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of
      our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy,
      liquidation, or similar proceeding or event, we may transfer the personal
      information we have collected or maintain to the buyer or other successor.
    </p>
    <p>Social Features</p>
    <p>
      The Platforms offers social features, including instant messaging, chat,
      email, and posting on message boards, that enable children to communicate
      with others through the Platforms.We do not control the types of
      information your child can send or post. We encourage parents to educate
      their children about safety online and to carefully monitor their
      children's use of social features to ensure they do not disclose their
      personal information through them.
    </p>
